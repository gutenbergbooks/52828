<h2 id="WATERMELON_PETE">WATERMELON PETE</h2>

<p>Once there was a little darky
boy, and his name was Watermelon
Pete. They called him Watermelon
Pete because his mouth was
just the shape of a <i>big</i>, slice of <i>ripe</i>
watermelon.</p>

<p>One night when old Mr. Moon
was looking in Watermelon Pete’s
window, and shining so bright
that he couldn’t go to sleep at <i>all</i>,
all at once he began to feel hungry.
And he said, “Oh, dear, I wish I
had a nice <i>big</i> piece of watermelon
to eat!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>And then a naughty little
Blackie, who was sitting on Watermelon
Pete’s bedpost, just <i>hoping</i>
that he would want to get out of
bed and get into mischief, said, “I
know where there are some watermelons.
Farmer Brown has some
down in his watermelon patch.”</p>

<p>And Watermelon Pete <i>listened</i>
to what the naughty little Blackie
said, and then he <i>crawled</i> out of
bed, and ran, oh, so fast, down to
the fence, and <i>scrooged</i> through a
hole in the fence, and ran&mdash;pitter-patter,
with his little bare black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
feet&mdash;down the path to the watermelon
vines.</p>

<p>Then he ate, and he ate, and
he <i>ate</i>, so many watermelons! And
by and by he went to sleep under
a watermelon vine. And Mr.
Moon went to bed.</p>

<p>Then pretty soon old Mr.
Rooster woke up and said, “Cock-a-doodle-doo-oo!
Farmer Brown,
I’m calling you-oo-o! It’s time
to get up!”</p>

<p>So Farmer Brown got up and
dressed himself, and went out of
doors. And then Farmer Brown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
said, “Well, I guess I’ll go and
see my watermelons.” And when
he got there he said, “Why!” just
like that. “Why, where are all my
lovely watermelons?”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then little Mrs. Hoppy Toad
came out from under a burdock
leaf where she lived, and said in
her funny little way-up-high voice,
“Farmer Brown, I know who ate
your watermelons!”</p>

<p>“Do you, Mrs. Hoppy Toad?”
said Farmer Brown. “And will
you tell me who it is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Farmer Brown,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
little Mrs. Hoppy Toad, in her
little way-up-high voice. “Watermelon
Pete ate your watermelons,
and he is asleep under your vines.”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>And then Watermelon Pete
woke, and he was so <i>frightened</i>,
because he had been naughty, that
he ran pitter-patter, pitter-patter,
up the path, and <i>what do you think</i>?</p>

<p>He was so full of watermelon
that he could <i>not</i> get back through
the hole in the fence, and Farmer
Brown caught him! And the
naughty Blackie just sat on a
fence post and <i>laughed</i> because he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
had made Watermelon Pete get
into mischief!</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>And Watermelon Pete said,
“Please, Farmer Brown, please
don’t punish me, and I will <i>never</i>
eat your watermelons <i>any more</i>!”</p>

<p>And Farmer Brown said, “All
right, Watermelon Pete, I will let
you off this time. But you must
never listen to that naughty
Blackie again. Now go and get
the cow and milk her, and then
come to breakfast.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Farmer Brown gave
Watermelon Pete a whole plate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
full of brown cakes for his breakfast,
with crinkly cronkly sirup
on them.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But the naughty Blackie
couldn’t have any.

<h2 id="LITTLE_BABY_ELEPHANT_AND_HIS_NEW_CLOTHES">LITTLE BABY
ELEPHANT
AND
HIS NEW CLOTHES</h2>

<p>Once there was a Daddy and a
Mammy Elephant, and they had
a little Baby Elephant.</p>

<p>When Daddy Elephant came
home one day he found his dear
little Baby Elephant crying great
big tears!</p>

<p>And Daddy Elephant kissed
him, and said, “Why, what’s the
matter with my little Baby Elephant?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>And Baby Elephant said,
“Why, Daddy, I’ve worn my
stockings all out, and I haven’t
any more to put on.”</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> all?” said Daddy Elephant.
“Well, come along, and
we will go and see if we can find
some stockings for you.”</p>

<p>So they went a <i>long</i> way,
through the Jungle, until they
came to Mrs. Lion’s store, and
they went in.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Lion,”
said Daddy Elephant, very politely.
“Have you some stockings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
that you will sell me for my little
Baby Elephant?”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>“Well, now, Daddy Elephant,”
said Mrs. Lion, “I don’t believe
I have any that would fit him;
they are all so small. But if you’ll
take a seat, I will ask my little
Lions to make him some.”</p>

<p>So she called four of her little
Lions, and asked them if they
would make some stockings for
Baby Elephant. They said they
would be pleased to do it, and so
they got some balls of wool and
began knitting so busily with their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
shiny knitting needles, click, click!
click, click! that pretty soon
there they were, four nice long new
stockings, one for each foot.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then Daddy Elephant paid for
the stockings and put them on
Baby Elephant. And Baby Elephant
said, “These are perfectly
lovely new stockings, Daddy, but
now, do you know, I believe I ought
to have some new shoes, so I won’t
spoil my nice new stockings.”</p>

<p>And Daddy Elephant said,
“Why, what a funny little Baby
Elephant you are! Just as soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
as you get one thing you think of
something else. But come along,
and we will see if we can find you
some shoes.”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So they went a long, <i>long</i> way
through the Jungle, until they
came to Mrs. Tiger’s store.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Tiger,”
said Daddy Elephant, very politely
indeed. “Have you some
shoes that you could sell me for
my little Baby Elephant?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Daddy Elephant,”
said Mrs. Tiger, “I haven’t any
big enough for him. But if you will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
take a seat and wait, I will call
my Tiger shoemakers, and have
some made for him.”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So they waited patiently while
the Tiger shoemakers made some
shoes. “Tip-a-tap, tip-a-tap, tip-a-tap-too!”
went the hammers,
until pretty soon there they were,
four nice new red shoes with one
for each foot.</p>

<p>Then Daddy paid Mrs. Tiger
for them, and put them on and
buttoned them up, and Baby
Elephant said, “My! These are
lovely new shoes, Daddy, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
thank you, but now I look so nice,
shouldn’t I have a hat?”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And Daddy Elephant laughed
and said, “Well, you <i>are</i> a funny
little Baby Elephant. But come
along, and I will see if I can find
a hat for you.”</p>

<p>So they walked and <i>walked</i> a
<i>long</i> way through the Jungle, and
after a while they came to Mrs.
Monkey’s millinery store.</p>

<p>And Daddy Elephant said, oh,
<i>very</i> politely, “How do you do,
Mrs. Monkey? Have you your
new spring hats in? My little

Baby thinks he’d like a hat.”</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And Mrs. Monkey said that
she didn’t believe she had a hat
that would quite fit Baby Elephant,
because they were very
small this season, but that she
would make him one. So she sent
her little Monkeys out into the
Jungle, and pretty soon they came
back with some palm-tree leaves.
And she sewed them into the
prettiest hat you ever saw.</p>

<p>But Baby Elephant wanted
trimming on his hat. So she found
some ribbon grass, and made some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
bows, and rosettes, and put them
on and Daddy Elephant paid her
for it, and they started out again.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then Baby Elephant laughed.
“Daddy, don’t I look funny with
my stockings and shoes and nice
new hat, and no coat on?”</p>

<p>And Daddy said, “Oh, you
funny baby! Well, come along,
and we’ll see if we can find you
a coat.” And they walked <i>and</i>
walked, and <i>nobody</i> could make a
coat until they came to where the
Tailor Bird lived. And he said he
could make a coat, “Just as <i>easy</i>!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>So he took a big piece of cloth,
and spread it on the ground, and
laid Baby Elephant down on it,
and cut a coat just like him, but
he got it a good deal too big, and
it has wrinkled ever since.</p>

<p>But Baby Elephant liked it, and
was very proud of his pretty new
things, and promised his Daddy
he would keep them all very nice.
And when he got home he ran and
kissed his Mammy Elephant, who
had just begun to wonder where
he and Daddy had been all day.</p>

<p>And then they all had supper.

<p>Elizabeth Gordon’s sympathetic understanding of the child mind
has placed her in the front rank as a writer of children’s books. It is
an art not to be acquired; but, when natural and inborn, children are
the first to recognize it. This tribute they have paid to Elizabeth
Gordon, a proof of which lies in the steadily growing demand for her
books.</p>

<p>No child can fail to follow with keenest delight these sketches of the
happenings of four days in the life of a little prairie dog. In the story
there is no perilous element, no fierceness or taking of life in fields or
woods. The gentler side of animal life is pictured, yet the story is
full of spirit and action. The illustrations show that command of
technique and that originality which, combined, hold young readers

the out-of-doors; the gurgling of brooks and the singing of birds unite
with the sweet fragrance of clover bloom and violet bank. The
imagination of the child is led out into varied channels, and a wholesome
love for birds and flowers and animals is instilled.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
